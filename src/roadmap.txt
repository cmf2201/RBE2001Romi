- setup which servo we are using
- define which pin the servo is using
- "stuck" and "finsihed" implimentations

MOVEMENT:
- Chassis.h

Blue Motor:
- Move to etc

REMOTE CONTROL:
- setup to "set" particular inputs to particular functions
- maybe "toggle" those functions to be "running" "stop running" or "run once"

ULTRASONIC:

LINE FOLLOWING:
- function to simply set up line following
- function for reseting current mode
- maybe function to adjust the compensation of the motors? (may just want to do this in main)
